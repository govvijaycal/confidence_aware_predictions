1) conda env create --file environment.yml
   Note: the requirements were combined from those involved in:
     - Carla leaderboard
     - nuscenes_devkit
     - l5kit

2) Set up L5Kit (govvijaycal fork).
	- cd l5kit/l5kit
    - make sure torch/torchvision are commented out in setup.py
    - pip install -e ."[dev]"

3) Set up Nuscenes (govvijaycal fork).
   - Add nuscenes-devkit directory to PYTHONPATH, like:
     export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:<path_to_nuscenes_devkit>/python-sdk"

4) Set up Carla.
	export CARLA_ROOT = "<path_to_carla>"
	export PYTHONPATH="${CARLA_ROOT}/PythonAPI/carla/:${PYTHONPATH}"
	export PYTHONPATH="${CARLA_ROOT}/PythonAPI/carla/dist/<path_to_egg>:${PYTHONPATH}"

	Note: the easy_install method didn't work for me, but this pythonpath modification works.
